The basketball network:

This is a social network for people  who play basketball in NYC.

Here you can keep track of your wins and losses, and also can challange players in your own GameBook!

Check out the Find A Park feature and you'll be able to see the nearest parks in NYC and how to get to them

Login System and Sign Up System is implemented well and there is also a leader board feature, which allows you to see 
who is ranked the highest amongst your pairs.
